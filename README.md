# cypress-eshop

## (implementation of basic tests for an example eshop)

## Requires:

##### npm

##### cypress

##### env\*

## How to run

#### From project's root:

```
npm run cy:open
```

#### notes:

##### Chrome is crashing in headed mode alot - might try to fix it later

##### create .env file based on .env_example form (\*for now it is not needed because we don't log in)

#### note for me:

##### maybe learn how to properly use .md format
